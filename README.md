##1. What are some differences between interfaces and types in TypeScript?
  i.   interface uses extends to connect to other interfaces but types uses & to connect other types.
  ii.  we can change interface after declaration but types cant be changed once they are declared.
  iii. we can use type for tuple, simple type settings bt interface can be use only to declare object.
  iv.  we can also use type through union and intersection but not in inerface.
  
## 2. Explain the difference between any, unknown, and never types in TypeScript.

### any-
It can be of any type. we wont get error for using any type.

### unknown-
It can be also of any type. But de need to declare a type before using it.
### never
This something that will never give any return. It is mosty used to catch error.
